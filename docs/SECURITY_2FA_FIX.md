# 🔒 2FA Security Fix Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the security fix for the **Critical 2FA Cookie Vulnerability** that was identified in the security audit.

## ⚠️ Security Issue Fixed
**Original Problem**: The 2FA verification cookie was set with `httpOnly: false`, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks where malicious JavaScript could steal the 2FA bypass token.

## ✅ Security Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Secure Cookie Configuration**
The 2FA verification cookie now uses these secure settings:
```typescript
cookieStore.set('2fa-verified', 'true', {
  httpOnly: true,        // ✅ Prevents JavaScript access (blocks XSS)
  secure: true,          // ✅ HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: 'strict',    // ✅ Prevents CSRF attacks
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 8,   // ✅ Reduced to 8 hours (was 24)
  path: '/',             // ✅ Site-wide availability
});
```

### 2. **Server-Side 2FA Status API**
Created `/api/2fa/status` endpoint that:
- ✅ Checks 2FA verification status server-side only
- ✅ Prevents client-side cookie manipulation
- ✅ Uses secure database queries
- ✅ Returns structured status information

### 3. **Updated Client-Side Implementation**
The `TwoFactorGuard` component now:
- ✅ Uses secure API calls instead of reading cookies
- ✅ No longer exposes security tokens to JavaScript
- ✅ Maintains the same user experience

## 📋 Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for enhanced security:

```bash
# Enhanced Security Configuration
NODE_ENV=production                    # Set to 'production' for live deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # Your app's URL for CORS

# Optional: Enhanced Cookie Security (Future Enhancement)
COOKIE_SECRET=your-random-32-char-secret    # For future cookie signing/encryption
SESSION_TIMEOUT=28800                       # 8 hours in seconds (current default)
```

## 🔄 Migration Steps

1. **No Database Changes Required** - The fix is purely application-level
2. **No User Impact** - Users will automatically get secure cookies on next login
3. **Existing Sessions** - Current 2FA sessions will continue working until expiry

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: XSS Protection
```javascript
// This should now return undefined (secure!)
console.log(document.cookie.match(/2fa-verified=([^;]+)/));
```

### Test 2: 2FA Status API
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://yourdomain.com/api/2fa/status
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "requires2FA": true,
  "verified": false
}
```

## 📊 Security Improvements Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **XSS Vulnerability** | ❌ Cookie readable by JS | ✅ httpOnly protection |
| **CSRF Protection** | ⚠️ sameSite: 'lax' | ✅ sameSite: 'strict' |
| **Session Duration** | ⚠️ 24 hours | ✅ 8 hours |
| **Client-Side Exposure** | ❌ Direct cookie access | ✅ Secure API only |
| **Attack Surface** | ❌ High | ✅ Minimal |

## 🚀 Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** in `next.config.mjs`
2. **Add rate limiting** to `/api/2fa/*` endpoints
3. **Enable HSTS headers** for production
4. **Regular security audits** of authentication flows

## 🔍 Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/2fa/verify-login/route.ts` - Secure cookie settings
2. `src/app/api/2fa/status/route.ts` - New secure status endpoint  
3. `src/components/2fa-guard.tsx` - Updated to use API instead of cookies
4. `src/middleware.ts` - Added new endpoint to public routes

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables added to `.env`
- [ ] Application restarted after env changes
- [ ] 2FA flow tested in incognito browser
- [ ] XSS test confirms cookie is not accessible to JavaScript
- [ ] All existing 2FA functionality works as expected
