# ðŸš¨ SECURITY: Remove Debug Code After Fix

## IMPORTANT: After resolving the Clerk secret key issue, remove these debugging additions:

### 1. Remove the debug endpoint file:
```bash
rm src/app/api/debug-runtime-env/route.ts
```

### 2. Clean up middleware (src/middleware.ts):
- Remove the console.log statements
- Remove the debug endpoint from public routes
- Keep only the essential middleware code

### 3. Remove this reminder file:
```bash
rm remove-debug-after-fix.md
```

## The debug endpoint `/api/debug-runtime-env` exposes environment information and should NOT remain in production!
